# CondorProduction

A general, extensible set of Python and Bash scripts to submit any job to the [HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) batch system.

This package focuses on the use of Condor with [CMSSW](http://cms-sw.github.io/) via the [LPC](https://lpc.fnal.gov/computing/index.shtml)
or [CMS Connect](https://connect.uscms.org/).

Currently in a pre-alpha state of development; caveat emptor.
